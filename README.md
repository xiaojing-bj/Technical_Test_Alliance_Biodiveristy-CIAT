# The report outlines the rationale of the analysis (including predictor selection), methods (including data sources, data preparation, and the model fitting), results, discussion, and references. 
# The scripts are executed in order as indicated by the numbers in their titles. 
# The model was an intentionally simple one. As I read literature on crop diversification in Viet Nam, I noticed the importance of rice domination and agricultural structural transformation. I felt these important trends could be best captured in a simple, hypotheses-based (instead of purely data-driven) model, as detialed in the report, and I found the results interesting. Of course, this simple model could be further refined using more advanced techniques - for example, using a structural equation modelling approach to capture the multiple ways that input level and irrigation influenced crop diversity.
